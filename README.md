# Visualizing-Gender-Gap-in-College-Degrees
This project uses matplotlib.

The Department of Education Statistics releases a data set annually containing the percentage of bachelor's degrees granted to women from 1970 to 2012. The data set is broken up into 17 categories of degrees, with each column as a separate category. Randal Olson, a data scientist at University of Pennsylvania, has cleaned the data set and made it available on his personal website. The data set has been provided in the repository as **percent-bachelors-degrees-women-usa.csv**. Randal compiled this data set to explore the gender gap in STEM fields, which stands for science, technology, engineering, and mathematics.

In this project we try to communicate the nuanced narrative of gender gap using effective data visualization.

The Jupyter Notebook file **Basics.ipynb** contains the desciption of the project along with the codes and their explanation. The final visualization looks like- ![this]( https://github.com/bhvya1505/Visualizing-Gender-Gap-in-College-Degrees/blob/master/gender_degrees.png)
